Customer Churn Analysis & Visualization – Internship Project
This repository contains all the tasks completed during my Business Analyst Internship at Saiket Systems. The project focuses on customer churn analysis in the telecommunications sector, with the goal of providing actionable insights to improve customer retention.

Project Overview
The primary objective was to analyze customer churn behavior, identify at-risk customers, and generate visual insights through data exploration, cleaning, and advanced segmentation.

Tasks Completed
✅ Task 1: Understand the Dataset
Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas.

Displayed the first 10 rows and identified data types.

Checked for missing values.

Skills: Data loading, dataset exploration, identifying data issues.

✅ Task 2: Data Cleaning
Handled missing values by filling or dropping them appropriately.

Removed duplicate records.

Standardized column names for consistency.

Skills: Data cleaning, handling missing values, data preparation.

✅ Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated summary statistics (mean, median, mode).

Visualized numerical data with histograms and box plots.

Analyzed churn vs. non-churn proportions.

Skills: Statistical analysis, data visualization.
Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn.

✅ Task 4: Customer Segmentation Visualization
Visualized customer distribution by tenure using pie/donut charts.

Compared average monthly charges across tenure categories using clustered bar charts with annotations.

Skills: Pie charts, interactive visualization.
Tools: Matplotlib, Plotly.

✅ Task 5: Advanced Analysis
Grouped customers by tenure to compute charges and churn statistics.

Analyzed churn by demographics (gender, senior citizens, payment methods, and contract types).

Identified patterns across customer lifecycle stages.

Skills: Data grouping, demographic analysis, comparative analysis.
Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook

Outcome
Provided actionable insights into customer churn behavior.

Identified key customer segments at risk of churn.

Delivered clear and interactive visualizations for decision-making.
